# User Guide fundamentals

Before going any further into this user guide, we recommend you to acknowledge the main concepts below. They will help you to understand how EcoFlowJS works, and ensure a smooth EcoFlowJS experience.

- **Authenticated or Secure Environment** <br/> When you start working on your application with out authenticate mode parameter, it is in a Authenticated environment, which is only one admin user and is authenticated by default. With the authenticate mode parameter, it is in Secure environment. In this mode user has to authenticated themself before accessing the dashboard.

- **Accessing the Editor** <br/> When in a Authenticated environment user has full access to all the editors in the application. when you start working on your application in a secure environment you should have permission to access the specific editor. In that case, please refer to the main Super Admin of your EcoFlowJS application.

- **Versions** <br/> EcoFlowJS is constantly evolving and growing. This implies that new releases are quite frequent, to improve what is already available but also to add new features to EcoFlowJS. We always recommend to use the latest version. However, we always keep live both the documentation of the current EcoFlowJS version, and the documentation of the previous major version â€” the latter being officially and actively maintained for up to 12 months after the release of the newest EcoFLowJS version.

- **License** <br/> EcoFlowJS is licensed under the [MIT license](../../dev-docs/License) and it is fully open source.

- **Future flags** <br/> Some incoming EcoFlowJS features are not yet ready to be shipped to all users, but EcoFlowJS still offers community users the opportunity to provide early feedback on these new features or changes. This feedback is invaluable in enhancing the feature before the final release.

- **Roles and Permissions** <br/> Some features of the admin panel, as well as the Schema Editor and Flow Editor are managed with EcoFlowJS itself, are ruled by a system of permissions. From your EcoFLowJS admin panel, you have the possibility to define, at a detailed level, the roles and permissions of all administrators and end users. In this user guide, all features and possible options are documented. It is however possible, depending on your role and permissions, that you may not be able to access all these features and options. In that case, please refer to the main Super Admin of your EcoFlowJS application.

With all this in mind, you should be ready to start your EcoFlowJS experience!
